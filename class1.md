How to Use System Restore in Windows

What is System Restore?: A tool that lets you return to a previous software, registry point and driver configuration known as a Restore Point. Basically it's undoing whatever changes you made when the restore point was created.

I'm focusing on the Newer Operating system instructions because it's what I'm currently using. No disrespect to Windows & XP. I’m going to pretend like that other one that shall remain nameless does not exist 

*The way you access system restore varies between the Windows versions. There are 3 separate procedures: One for Windows 10, 8, and 8.1. One for Windows 7 or Vista ( A terrible version ugh what were they thinking) and a Version for XP ( who is still using XP and why?)

Windows 10, 8, 8.1 Procedure 

Go to the Control Panel ( you can search for it by typing it in the search box in the task bar.
Select Systems and Security 
In the Systems and Security window select System.
Then choose system protection which should be on the left of the screen.
A systems properties window will pop up and then you click on the system restore button and if you don't see it make sure you are on the system protection tab.
Click next in the window called Restore System Files and Settings. If you did a system restore before you might see an option to restore settings and choose a restore point. If you do click on choose a different restore point if you are not trying to undo one 
Choose a restore point from the list 
Click on the next button
Confirm the restore point and then select finish.

Restoring your system will not affect any non system files such as documents, pictures, music, etc. 
Usually restore points do not need to be manually created, if the system is working properly then it will do it automatically and regularly.
Also system restore can be started using the command prompt rstrui.exe. It can be helpful in certain situations such as if you need to run it from safe mode.
