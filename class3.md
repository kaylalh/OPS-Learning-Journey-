#  IT'S GO TIME

Over the past several months I've been in a OPS bootcamp to expand my tech knowledge and I'm burnt out but not enough to give up. I now know what I wan to focus on which is the cloud. First I started learning AWS and I took the Cloud Practiner Test. I was so close and yet so far to passing the test on the first try. I also stated looking into AZURE. The mistake I made was trying to learn both at once (never again). They are very simliar and different at the same time. 

My goal for this blog is to add something everyday. It could be my thoughts on tech news, my job search, cert study updates, labs, etc
